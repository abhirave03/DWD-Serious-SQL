#### Bonus Question
#### 11. Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL Recreate the following table output using the available data.
   ```sql
   SELECT
      sales.customer_id,
      sales.product_id,
      sales.order_date,
      members.join_date,
      CASE
         WHEN sales.order_date >= members.join_date THEN 'Y'
         ELSE 'N'
      END AS member
   FROM dannys_diner.sales
   FULL JOIN dannys_diner.members
   ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id;
   ```
 
#### Result

#### 12.Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS purchases;
   CREATE TEMP TABLE purchases AS
   WITH CTE AS(
   SELECT
      sales.customer_id,
      sales.product_id,
      sales.order_date,
      members.join_date,
      CASE
         WHEN sales.order_date >= members.join_date THEN 'Y'
         ELSE 'N'
      END AS member
   FROM dannys_diner.sales
   FULL JOIN dannys_diner.members
   ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id)
   SELECT
      customer_id,
      product_id,
      order_date,
      join_date,
      member,
      RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY member) AS ranked
   FROM CTE;
   ```
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id,

      CASE WHEN 
         ranked = 1 THEN null 
         ELSE  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, member ORDER BY order_date)
      END AS ranked1
   FROM purchases;
   ```

##  Data Sets
### Table 1: Plans
- Customers can choose which plans to join Foodie-Fi when they first sign up.
- Basic plan customers have limited access and can only stream their videos and is only available monthly at $9.90.
- Pro plan customers have no watch time limits and are able to download videos for offline viewing. Pro plans start at $19.90 a month or $199 for an annual subscription.
- Customers can sign up to an initial 7 day free trial will automatically continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel, downgrade to basic or upgrade to an annual pro plan at any point during the trial.
- When customers cancel their Foodie-Fi service - they will have a churn plan record with a null price but their plan will continue until the end of the billing period.

### Table 1: Subscriptions
- Customer subscriptions show the exact date where their specific plan_id starts.
- If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription - the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over - the start_date in the subscriptions table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.
- When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or annual pro plan - the higher plan will take effect straightaway.
- When customers churn - they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period but the start_date will be technically the day they decided to cancel their service.

## Case Study Question and Answer
### A. Customer Journey
#### 1. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
  ```sql
  SELECT * 
  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
  INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans
  ON plans.plan_id = subscriptions.plan_id
  WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 25, 39, 42)
  ORDER BY customer_id;
  ```

#### Result
   | customer_id    | plan_id        | start_date     | plan_name      | price          |

#### 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
  ```sql
  WITH CTE AS(
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    plan_id,
    start_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
      PARTITION BY customer_id

    )AS plan_rank
  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
  WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31' and plan_id NOT IN('3','4')
  ORDER BY customer_id
  )
  SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS dowgradedcustomer
  FROM CTE 
  WHERE plan_rank = 2;
  ```

#### Result
   | dowgradedcustomer |
   |:-----------------:|
   |        163        | 
   
### C. Challenge Payment Question
#### 1. The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements: monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan, upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately, upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period, once a customer churns they will no longer make payments.

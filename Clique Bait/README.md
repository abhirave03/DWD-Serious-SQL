### C. Product Funnel Analysis
#### 1. Create a new output table which has the following details: How many times was each product viewed?, How many times was each product added to cart? ,How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?, How many times was each product purchased?, Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.
   ```sql
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
  CREATE TEMP TABLE t1 AS
  WITH CTE AS(
  SELECT
    events.visit_id,
    page_hierarchy.product_id,
    page_hierarchy.page_name,
    page_hierarchy.product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS productviewed,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS addedtocart
  FROM clique_bait.events
  INNER JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy
  ON events.page_id = page_hierarchy.page_id
  WHERE page_hierarchy.product_category IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY page_hierarchy.product_id, page_hierarchy.product_category, page_hierarchy.page_name, events.visit_id
  ORDER BY page_hierarchy.product_id
  ),
  cte1 AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    visit_id
  FROM clique_bait.events
  WHERE event_type = 3 
  ),
  cte2 AS (
  SELECT
    t1.visit_id,
    t1.product_id,
    t1.page_name,
    t1.product_category,
    t1.productviewed,
    t1.addedtocart,
    CASE WHEN t2.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as purchase
  FROM cte AS t1
  LEFT JOIN cte1 AS t2
  ON t1.visit_id = t2.visit_id
  )
  SELECT
    product_id,
    page_name AS product,
    product_category,
    SUM(productviewed) AS page_views,
    SUM(addedtocart) AS cart_adds,
    SUM(CASE WHEN addedtocart = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
    SUM(CASE WHEN addedtocart = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
  FROM cte2
  GROUP BY product_id, product_category, product
  ORDER BY product_id;


  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t2;
  CREATE TEMP TABLE t2 AS
  SELECT
    product_category,
    SUM(page_views) AS page_views,
    SUM(cart_adds) AS cart_adds,
    SUM(abandoned) AS abandoned,
    SUM(purchases) AS purchases
  FROM t1
  GROUP BY product_category
  ORDER BY product_category;
  ```

#### 1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?
  ```sql
  SELECT
  * FROM t1 
  ORDER BY page_views DESC;
    
  SELECT
  * FROM t1 
  ORDER BY cart_adds DESC;
    
  SELECT
  * FROM t1 
  ORDER BY purchases DESC;
  ```
  
#### 2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    product,
    ROUND(100 * abandoned/cart_adds) AS percentage
  FROM t1 
  ORDER BY percentage DESC
  LIMIT 1;
  ```
#### Result
  |      product     |    percentage  |
  |:----------------:|:--------------:|
  |  Russian Caviar  |      26        |

#### 3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?
  ```sql
  SELECT
    product,
    ROUND(100 * purchases/page_views,2) AS percentage
  FROM t1 
  ORDER BY percentage DESC
  LIMIT 1;
  ```
#### Result
  |      product     |    percentage  |

  |         75.92           |
  
### Part D. Campaigns Analysis
#### 1. 
  ```sql
  SELECT
    users.user_id,
    events.visit_id,

    STRING_AGG(
    CASE
      WHEN page_hierarchy.product_id IS NOT NULL AND event_type = 2
      THEN page_hierarchy.page_name
      ELSE NULL END,
      ', ' ORDER BY events.sequence_number
    ) AS cart_products
  FROM clique_bait.events
  INNER JOIN clique_bait.users
  ON events.cookie_id = users.cookie_id
  INNER JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy
  ON events.page_id = page_hierarchy.page_id
  LEFT JOIN clique_bait.campaign_identifier
  ON events.event_time BETWEEN campaign_identifier.start_date AND campaign_identifier.end_date
  WHERE users.user_id = 1
  GROUP BY users.user_id, events.visit_id, campaign_identifier.campaign_name
  ORDER BY users.user_id;
  ```
#### Result
